## News App Laravel

This code repo is built by Laravel framework.

## Brief

The app we are building today is a proof of concept prototype towards a
news search / research tool where a user could:

- Search against one or more news sites / services for terms they are
  interested in
- Get a collated list of results, click through to read further the
  articles of interest.


## Spec
A web endpoint that takes a user search query as a string
* It should use this string to search against at least two different news sources
* One of those can be the guardian as you used already
* The New York Times has a similar API you could use:
